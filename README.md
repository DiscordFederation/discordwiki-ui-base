# Discord Base stylesheet variables

Discord Base repository provides stylesheets with variables containing
Discord Foundation basic user interface style values.
We are providing:
 - `discord-ui-base.css` file containing the variables in CSS Custom Properties syntax,
 preferably used with PostCSS
 - `discord-ui-base.less` file containing the variables in LESS syntax

## Install
Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DiscordFederation/discordwiki-ui-base.git`.

It is recommended that you include `discord-ui-base.css` or
`discord-ui-base.less` file as untouched library code at top of
central stylesheet file and – if necessary – add changes by overwriting
the variable later in your code.
